This is a work in progress project to answer the following question: How much single-family zoning is there within a 15-minute walk of Washington, DC's West of the Park metro stations? 

West of the Park is one of ten DC Office of Planning neighborhood planning areas. It is the city's wealthiest and whitest, with the highest concentration of exlusionary zoning. 

The current version of the live site is here, although functionality is very much a work in progress: https://defrank1.github.io/class-3-project/

TravelTime API was used to generate the 15-minute walkshed, and JoshData's wmata-track-locations repository was used to generate station lines: https://github.com/JoshData/wmata-track-locations. Stations themselves were sourced from WMATA's developer tools. The icons were created by yours truly in Adobe Illustrator.

I would like to add actual zoning or housing data within the walksheds at some point, but for now, you can use the map's 3D functionality to physically see the areas where there are lower densities by building size.
